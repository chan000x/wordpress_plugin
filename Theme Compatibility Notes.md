# Theme Compatibility Notes

## [Astra](https://wordpress.org/themes/astra/)

All menus are confirmed to work with a fresh installation of the Astra theme.  Astra has separate menus for desktop and mobile which is not something Multi Menu accounts for.  If you are using Astra, we recommend using the plugin for your desktop menu and then using the built in menu provided by Astra for your mobile menu.

## [Blocksy](https://wordpress.org/themes/blocksy/)

All menus appear to work well on desktop, but Blocksy hides the mobile menu behind its own menu toggle.  This results in a double menu, where the user has to click the Blocksy menu toggle, then the Multi Menu menu toggle to open the menu.  This is corrected for in the theme specific blocksy.css files for each of the various menus.

## [GeneratePress](https://wordpress.org/themes/generatepress/)

GeneratePress has some really funky default CSS for the primary menu.  With the theme specific overrides CSS enabled the menus should work properly with the GeneratePress theme.

## [Kadence](https://wordpress.org/themes/kadence/)

All menus work with Kadence when the theme specific overrides CSS is enabled.  Kadence took quite a bit of customizing to get the various menus looking good on a default install of the theme, but everything is now confirmed to be working with the CSS overrides.

## [Neve](https://wordpress.org/themes/neve/)

All menus work with Neve.  Enhancements for Neve are enabled when the theme specific CSS is loaded.
